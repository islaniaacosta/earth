   <div><h3>Renewable in the U.S.</h3></div>
     <p>Wind, solar, and storage hybrid energy plants are one of the largest in the country. Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility is located in Oregon and combines a wind farm, solar array, and battery storage. The project will help comply with a 2021 Oregon State Law stating that major utilities must reduce emissions from generating electricity by 100 percent by 2040, creating clean electricity sources and new jobs. The state is experiencing wildfires, extreme heat, winter storms, and droughts due to climate change’s impact; the new plants will help counter those effects. Also developed by NextEra, the Skeleton Creek project in Oklahoma will also be going live next year. This plant will have 250 megawatts of wind, 250 megawatts of solar power, and a 200-megawatt battery storage system.</p>
